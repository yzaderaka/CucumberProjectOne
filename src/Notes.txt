Maven lifecycle consist of several phase

2. Validate: Checks the project is correct and all the necessary information is available
3. Compile: compiles the source code of the project
4. Test: runs the tests for the project
5. Package: packages the compiles code into distributable format, such as JAR or WAR files
6. Verify: runs and checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria is met
7. Install: installs the packages into local repository
8. Site: generates documentation for the project
9. Deploy: copies the final package to remote repository for sharing with other developers or projects

=====================JDBC notes============================
recap -
mysql connector java is the dependency we have added

we need 3 things to work with DB
address of DB - URL
Name of DB -
Usewrname, Password -

Connection class - to establish the connection with DB
make a statement - it allows us to send the query to the DB
resultset - the result will be stored its object

rset.next() - to shift the cursor on to the next line/row

resultmetadata - it contains the information about the result such as how many columns are there,
how many rows, name of columns/rows e.t.c.

--------------------------------

to integrate with framework, we will pass url, username and password in config.prop

in order to integrate our DB in framework, we create dbutility class
